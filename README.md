Lab 1
=====
Updated by Chu Sik Jang
This lab introduces you to the serving of static content using node.js and Express. We'll also push and pull from GitHub, and publish to Heroku.

Originally created by Scott Klemmer, Michael Bernstein, and a coalition of TAs. This version forked from https://github.com/IntroHCI/lab1 and modified by Philip Guo.
